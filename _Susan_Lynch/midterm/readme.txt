DPLA or the Digital Public Library of America is a new digital library with ambitious plans.  It's intended to serve be a union metadata repository for all of digital libraries in the United States.  

This makes it comparable to the EU's Europeana, France's Gallica...

The project is still in it's infancy and therefore the metadata repository is still only sparsely populated.  

Unlike some other repositories, DPLA contains metadata only and not the object itself.DPLA contains a hyperlink which points back to each object's home repository.
